          ⚪️ As a child, I was <del>forced</del> urged to learn the piano. I am
          grateful now but as a kid, I did not appreciate the early Saturday
          morning lessons. My brothers and I were trained by the same piano
          teacher, Mr. Leroy Moore. I owe my strong attention to detail,
          dexterity, and second-hand pointers in extreme patience to him!<br />
          ⚪️ In the midst of piano, books and daydreaming, I developed a strong
          desire to learn about structures and art. After high school, I moved
          to San Antonio to attend college and studied both Architecture and
          Interior Environmental Design from the University of Texas at San
          Antonio and the University of the Incarnate Word, respectively. The
          two subjects gave me the knowledge & foundation to go forth and begin
          my career as a designer.<br />
          ⚪️ After graduation, I had the pleasure of working with the City
          Architect's office in San Antonio and got to work on some pretty cool
          projects. My favorite projects were the Tobin Center for the
          Performing Arts and the many renovation projects along the Riverwalk.
          I sometimes could not believe what I was involved with at such a young
          age and valued every moment I had there. <br />
          ⚪️ After the City, I worked with a San Antonio-based architecture
          firm which handled government projects. We completed renovations and
          new construction for military bases, air fields, schools, and various
          ports of entry along the Texas/Mexico border. <br />
          ⚪️ A few years later, I relocated to Dallas to begin a new adventure
          as a 3D Branded Environment designer for a production company which
          produced live corporate events around the world. It was by far the
          coolest job I have ever had. Our clients were many, but most notably
          we worked with companies such as: Tableau, Mary Kay, Northwestern
          Mutual, Apple, HBO, Disney and many more. These live events were epic,
          for the lack of a better word. Each year, our clients desired bigger
          and better shows which challenged me as a designer to stay current
          with new technologies and design trends. We designed stages for
          speakers & presentations, one-of-a-kind, branded bar & coffee shops,
          and various "instagrammable moments", providing them with a memorable
          experience. It was incredibly amazing, at times extremely challenging,
          but all in all, the best experience I've had to date. <br />
          ⚪️ I have learned that no role is too small or insignificant. Teams
          thrive when there is mutual understanding, communication,
          encouragement, and respect. I look forward to applying my past
          experiences and newfound knowledge to my next projects and teams.
