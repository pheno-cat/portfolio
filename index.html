          ⚪️ As a child, I was <del>forced</del> urged to learn the piano. I am
          grateful now but as a kid, I did not appreciate the early Saturday
          morning lessons. My brothers and I were trained by the same piano
          teacher, Mr. Leroy Moore. I owe my strong attention to detail,
          dexterity, and second-hand pointers in extreme patience to him!<br />
          ⚪️ In the midst of piano, books and daydreaming, I developed a strong
          desire to learn about structures and art. After high school, I moved
          to San Antonio to attend college and studied both Architecture and
          Interior Environmental Design from the University of Texas at San
          Antonio and the University of the Incarnate Word, respectively. The
          two subjects gave me the knowledge & foundation to go forth and begin
          my career as a designer.<br />
          ⚪️ After graduation, I had the pleasure of working with the City
          Architect's office in San Antonio and got to work on some pretty cool
          projects. My favorite projects were the Tobin Center for the
          Performing Arts and the many renovation projects along the Riverwalk
          (which we got to travel to by the city's own river barge!). I
          sometimes could not believe what I was involved with at such a young
          age and valued every moment I had there. <br />
          ⚪️ After the City, I worked with a San Antonio-based architecture
          firm which handled government projects. We completed renovations and
          new construction for military bases, air fields, schools, and various
          ports of entry along the Texas/Mexico border. <br />
          ⚪️ A few years later, I relocated to Dallas to begin a new adventure
          as a 3D Branded Environment designer for a production company which
          produced live corporate events around the world. It was by far, the
          coolest job I have ever had. Our clients were many, but most notably
          we worked with companies such as: Tableau, Mary Kay, Cetera Financial
          Group, Apple, HBO, and many more. These live events were epic, for the
          lack of a better word. Each year, our clients desired bigger and
          better shows, sometimes feeling more like a rock concert/carnival
          masquerading as a corporate event - which was okay with me! We
          designed stages speakers, one-of-a-kind bar & coffee shops, and
          various "instagrammable moments", providing them with a memorable
          experience. It was incredibly amazing, at times extremely challenging,
          but all in all, the best experience I've had to date. <br />
          ⚪️ All these paths have led me to my new career as a full stack web
          developer. What a long, strange trip it's been... I look forward to
          partnering with you and creating something fantastic.
