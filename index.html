          ⚪️ Believe it or not, the hospital staff at the hospital where I was
          born took the liberty of spelling my name "Catherine" instead of the
          what my mother intended, which was "Catarina". I figure if I go by
          "Cat", it would be correct either way. I was born and raised in the
          heart of Texas, in a small town called Ballinger. <br />
          ⚪️ I was raised in a very creative home. My mother painted, my father
          is a carpenter, and my two older brothers became an architect and a
          director. My brothers and I were classically trained at piano by the
          same piano teacher, Mr. Leroy Moore. I owe my strong attention to
          detail and dexterity to him!<br />
          ⚪️ In the midst of piano, books and daydreaming, I developed a strong
          desire to learn about structures and art. So after high school, I
          moved to San Antonio to attend college and studied both Architecture
          and Interior Environmental Design from the University of Texas at San
          Antonio and the University of the Incarnate Word, respectively. The
          two subjects gave me the knowledge & foundationto go forth and begin
          my career as a designer. I had dreams of becoming a wonderous
          architect like Tadao Ando or I.M. Pei, both of whom I still admire.<br />
          ⚪️ After graduation, I had the pleasure of working with the City
          Architect's office in San Antonio and got to work on some pretty cool
          projects. My favorite projects were the Tobin Center for the
          Performing Arts and the many renovation projects along the Riverwalk
          (which we got to travel to by the city's own river barge!). I
          sometimes could not believe what I was involved with at such a young
          age and valued every moment I had there. <br />
          ⚪️ After the City, I worked with a San Antonio-based architecture
          firm which handled government projects. We completed renovations and
          new construction for military bases, air fields, schools, and various
          ports of entry along the Texas/Mexico border. <br />
          ⚪️ A few years later, I relocated to Dallas to begin a new adventure
          as a 3D Branded Environment designer for a production company which
          produced live corporate events around the world. It was by far, the
          coolest job I have ever had. Our clients were many, but most notably
          we worked with companies such as: Tableau, Google, Apple, HBO, Lego,
          and so on. These live events were epic, for lack of a better word.
          Each year, these companies wanted bigger and better shows, sometimes
          feeling like a rock concert/carnival masquerading as a corporate
          event. We designed stages for their keynote speakers & musical guests,
          their LED lights, one-of-a-kind bar & coffee shops, ball pits, slides,
          instagrammable moments, and most exciting, a permanent Game of Thrones
          museum in Belfast, Ireland. It was incredibly amazing, at times
          extremely challenging, but all in all, the best experience I've had to
          date. <br />
          ⚪️ Now that the world has halted a bit, it is time to turn my focus
          on something a little more different. I'm looking forward to seeing
          where this new knowledge will take me!
