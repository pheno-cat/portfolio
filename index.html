          My name is Catherine Jalomo, but you can call me Cat. I was born and
          raised in the heart of Texas, in a small town called Ballinger.
          Growing up, I often dreamed of being somewhere, anywhere else but I am
          grateful for my upbringing and would not trade it for anything. After
          high school, I moved to San Antonio to attend college and studied both
          Architecture and Interior Environmental Design from the University of
          Texas at San Antonio and the University of the Incarnate Word,
          respectively. I had dreams of becoming a wonderous architect like
          Tadao Ando or I.M. Pei. After graduation, I had the pleasure of
          working with the City Architect's office in San Antonio and got to
          work on some pretty cool projects. My favorite projects were the Tobin
          Center for the Performing Arts and the many renovation projects along
          the Riverwalk (which we got to travel to by the city's own river
          barge!). I sometimes could not believe what I was involved with at
          such a young age and valued every moment I had there. After the City,
          I worked with a San Antonio-based architecture firm which handled
          government projects. We completed renovations and new construction for
          military bases, air fields, schools, and various ports of entry along
          the Texas/Mexico border. A few years later, I relocated to Dallas to
          begin a new adventure as a 3D Branded Environment designer for a
          production company which produced live corporate events around the
          world. It was by far, the coolest job I have ever had. Our clients
          were many, but most notably we worked with companies such as: Tableau,
          Google, Apple, HBO, Lego, and so on. These live events were epic, for
          the lack of a better word. Each year, these companies wanted bigger
          and better shows, sometimes feeling like a rock concert/carnival
          masquerading as a corporate event. We designed stages for their
          keynote speakers & musical guests, their LED lights, one-of-a-kind bar
          & coffee shops, ball pits, slides, instagrammable moments, and most
          exciting, a permanent Game of Thrones museum in Belfast, Ireland. It
          was amazing, at times extremely challenging, but all in all, the best
          experience I've had to date. Now that the world has halted a bit, it
          is time to turn my focus on something a little more different. I'm
          looking forward to seeing where this new knowledge will take me!
